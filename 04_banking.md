# Banking

## Bank balance sheet

**Bank balance sheet** is a list of the bank's assets and liabilities.

### Liabilities

1. Checkable deposits

Includes all accounts on which checks can be drawn.

2. Non-transactional deposits

Saving accounts and time deposits. Time deposits have a fixed maturity and are
separated to small-denominated (<$100k) and large-denominated deposits.

3. Borrowings

Loans from the Fed (discount loans) or other banks or corporations.

4. Bank capital

Difference between assets and liabilities. The bank's net worth.

### Asets

1. Reserves

i. Required assets, as imposed by the central bank. A percentage of the bank's
deposits.

ii. Excess reserves, held by the bank to meet withdraw obligations

2. Cash items in process of collection

For example, deposited checks from other banks

3. Deposits at other banks

4. Securities

i. US government securities
ii. State and local government securities
iii. other securities

5. Loans

## Bank management

The bank manager has four primary concerns:
1. Make sure there are enough ready cash for deposit outflows (liquidity management)
2. Pursue an acceptable low level of risk by acquiring assets with a low default risk
and diversify assets (asset management)
3. Acquire funds at low cost (liability management)
4. Decide on the amount of capital (adequacy management)

### Liquidity management

Not enough reserves in a bank balance sheet:
1. Borrow from other banks or corporations
2. Sell some of its securities
3. Borrow from the central bank (discount loans)
4. Reduce loans. Either call them in or sell them to other banks (costliest option)

Excess reserves are insurance against the costs associated with deposit outflows. Banks
are willing to pay the cost of holding excess reserves instead of holding more income-
earning assets (opportunity cost).

### Asset management

1. Seek the highest returns possible on loans and securities
2. Reduce risk
 - Purchase securities with high returns and low risk
 - Diversify, eg., do not lend only to a specific industry
3. Make adequate provisions for liquidity by holding liquid assets. Satisfy reserves
requirements w/o bearing huge costs. Hold liquid securities even if their return is lower
than others

### Liability management

Before the 60s, fairly ignored. After the 60s, banks started exploring ways in which their
liabilities could provde them with reserve and liquidity.

### Capital adequacy management

1. A bank maintains bank capital to lessen the chance that it will become insolvent.
2. Given the returns on assets, the lower the bank capital, the higher the return for the owners
of the bank.
3. A minimum amount of bank capital is required by regulatory authorities.

A shortfall of bank capital is likely to lead to a bank reducing its assets and therefore a
contraction in lending.


## Managing risk

### Credit risk

**Credit risk** is the risk arising because borrowers may default.

Ways to mitigate:

1. Screening and monitoring

Assymetric information is when lenders have less information about the investment opportunities
and activities of borrowers than borrowers do.

i. Screening
ii. Specialization in lending
iii. Monitoring and enforcement of restrictive covenants

2. Long-term customer relationships

Review customer account history. Reduce the cost of information collection/monitoring.

3. Loan commitments

A bank's commitment for a specified future period of time to provide a firm with loans up to a
given amount at an interest rate that is tied to some market interest rate.

4. Collateral and compensating balances

Property promised to the lender in case the borrower defaults.

Compensating balances is an amount of money the borrower has to keep in a checking account in
the bank. It serves as both collateral and a way to monitor the borrower's financial activities.

5. Credit rationing

A lender refuses to make a loan of any amount to a borrower, even if the borrower is willing to
pay a higher interest rate.

A lender is willing to make a loan but restricts the size of the loan to less than the borrower
would like.

### Interest rate risk

If a bank has more rate-sensitive liabilities than assets, a rise in interest rates will reduce
bank profits and a decline in interest rates will raise bank profits.

#### Gap analysis

The amount of rate-sensitive liabilities is subtracted from the amount of rate-sensitive assets (gap).

Multiply the gap with the change in the interest rates (basic gap analysis)

Standardized gap analysis accounts for the different degrees of rate sensitivity for different rate-
sensitive assets and liabilities

#### Duration analysis

Examine the sensitivity of the market value of the bank's total assets and liabilities to changes in
interest rates.

```
% change in market value of security ~= -% change in interest rate x duration in years
```

Also, trade financial futures, options for debt instruments, and interest-rate swaps.


## Off-balance-sheet activities

Trade of financial instruments and generation of income from fees and loan sales are activities that
affect bank profits but do not show up in bank balance sheets.

1. Loan sales

A contract that sells all or part of the cash stream from a specific loan and thereby removes the loan
from a bank's sheet.

2. Generation of fee income sources

i. specialized services to customers such as making foreign exchange trades.
ii. servicing a mortgage-backed security by collecting interest and principal payments and then paying
them out.
iii. guaranteeing debt securities
iv. backup lines of credit

3. Trading activities and risk management techniques

Speculation in the foreign exchange market.

Subject to the principal-agent problem. Solve with:
i. separation of people in charge of trading activities from those in charge of bookkeeping for trades
ii. set limits on the total amount of trader transactions
iii. securitize risk assessment procedures using latest technology

Value-at-risk approach: calculate the maximum loss a portfolio is likely to sustain over a given time


## Purchasing Power Parity

The exchange rate between two countries is equal to the ration of the currencies' respective purchasing
power. The assumption is that it would cost exactly the same amount of US dollars to buy euro and then
buy a market-based good as it would cost to directly purchase the good with dollars. A fail in either
currency's purchasing power would lead to a proportional decrease in that currency's valuation in the
foreign exchange market.

Based on the Law of One Price but instead of applying on individual prices, it applies in national price
levels.

### Law of One Price

In the absence of transaction costs and official trade barriers, identical goods will have the same price
in different markets when the prices are expressed in the same currency.

Useful for making comparisons between countries. Also, exchange rates tend to move in the general direction
of the PPP exchange rate.

**Cannot fully explain exchange rates**: Because of the assumptions that all goods are identical in both
countries and that transportation costs and trade barriers are very low.
* Not all types of products are identical (eg., Mercedes vs Toyota)
* Not every good and service is traded across borders


## Shadow banking system

The traditional banking business of making loans that are funded by deposits has been in decline, replaced
by lending via the securities market.

Financial engineering is when financial institutions have to research and develop new products and services
that will meet customer demand and prove profitable.

### Financial innovations

#### Responses to changes in demand

eg. interest rate volatility: adjustable-rate mortgages and financial derivatives

#### Responses to changes in supply

eg. information technology: lower cost of transactions, easier to acquire information

* bank credit and debit cards
* electronic banking
* junk bonds

With the improvements in IT, screening has become easier which in turn has resulted in investors being more
willing to buy long-term debt securities from less well-known corporations with lower credit ratings (companies
that have not yet achieved investement-grade status).

* commercial paper market

Short-term debt securities issued by large banks and corporations

* securitization

The process of transforming otherwise illiquid financial assets, such as bank loans and mortgages into
marketable securities.

#### Avoidance of existing regulations

Loophole mining: more likely to occur under burdensome regulatory constraints, eg., reserve requirements
and restrictions on interest paid on deposits.

i. Money Market Mutual Funds

Issue shares redeemable at a fixed price. Like checking accounts that earn interest, but they are not
legally deposits so they are not subject to reserve requirements or prohibitions on interest rate payments.

ii. Sweep accounts

Balances above a certain amount in a corporation's checking account at the end of a business day are "swept
out" of the account and invested in overnight securities that pay interest.

iii. Branching restrictions

Banks were not allowed to open branches outside of the state of their headquarters. This resulted in:
* bank holding companies, corporations that own several different companies
* ATMs
