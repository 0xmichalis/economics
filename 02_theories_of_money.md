## Theories of money

### Orthodox theory

Barter replaced self-sufficiency and increased efficiency by allowing for specialization.
Then, it was discovered that using some object as medium of exchange could eliminate the
necessity of the *coincidence of wants*. Money is created to minimize transaction costs.

Reality: there was never a general economic system based on barter.

Orthodox theory assumes rational actors. It is prevalent because of political and power
struggles.

### Metallism (Commodity theory)

The value of money is derived from the purchasing power of the commodity upon which it is based.

### Keynesian theory

Focus on using active government policy to manage aggregate demand in order to address or
prevent economic recessions.

If prices are slow to change, this makes it possible to use money supply as a tool and change
interest rates to encourage borrowing and lending. Lowering interest rates is one way governments
can meaningfully intervene in economic systems, thereby encouraging consumption and investment
spending. Short-term demand increases initiated by interest rate cuts reinvigorate the economic
system and restore employment and demand for services. The new economic activity then feeds
continued growth and employment.  

### Social theories

Actions based on expectations (Max Weber)

### Labor theory (Marx)

Value is the embodiment of socially necessary labor, so commodities exchange with each
other in proportion to labor type of commodity theory.

### Austrian theory

Money is a commodity used for exchange. Like any other commodity, its value is determined
by supply and deman. Increase in supply does not benefit the society.

Regression theorem: Money has value today because it had value yesterday. Its value thus
can be tracked all the way back to when it was a commodity and had value in the barter system.

### Credit theory

Medium of exchange and record of debt owned
- Credit equals debt
- depends on POV
- money has value because it can cancel debts

### State theory

The state names the valuable thing.

The state accept the unit account for taxes.

Special case of Credit Theory.

### Modern monetary theory (Neo-Chartalism)

The government still controls money (State Theory + Credit Theory)

The government does not borrow, just issues more money

The government never goes bankrupt.

### Quantity Theory
```
MV = PQ
```
M: Money supply
V: Velocity
P: Average price levels
Q: Goods and services

General price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money
in circulation.

Modern economists accept it in the long run but in the short-term, prices are sticky

#### Velocity of money

How fast money passes from one holder to the next.

Income velocity: frequency of a uit of currency used in transactions per time
Transaction velocity: frequency of average unit of currency changing possession in transactions

#### Quantitative Easing

Expansionary monetary policy whereby a central bank predetermines amounts of government bonds
or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity. It helps
manage inflation rates.

Risks:
1. Too effective policy in fighting deflation can lead to higher inflation than expected longer term
2. not effective enough; banks remain reluctant to lend and potential borrowers not willing to borrow
