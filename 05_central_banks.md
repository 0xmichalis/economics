# Central Banks

* Control monetary supply
* Oversee commercial banking system
* Set the official interest rate
* Implement monetary policies
* The government's banker and the banker's bank (lender of last resort)
* Manage forex rates and gold reserves

### Goals

* Price stability
* High employment
* Economic growth

**Float**: the Fed , when clearing checks, first credits the amount of a check to a bank, hence
temporarily increasing the monetary supply, then debits the check on the bank from which the check
is drawn.

## Central bank independence (CBI)

In favor of CBI:
* free of political influence (political business cycle)
* politicians are not economists

Against CBI:
* undemocratic to have monetary policy controlled by an elite group that is not responsible to anyone
* unaccountable
* difficult to coordinate monetary and fiscal policy

## Central bank balance sheet

Assets:
* securities issued by the government
* loans to financial institutions. The interest rate for these loans is called the discount rate

Liabilites:
* currency in circulation
* reserves

**Money multiplier**: relates an increase in reserves to an increase in deposits

```
MM = (1/r) * R
```
eg., for a required reserve ratio (r) of 5% and R=$1, MM is $20

## Monetary policy

The tools and actions that a central bank uses to achieve its goals.

Includes:
* Open market operations (OMO)
* Borrowed reserves (discount policy)
* Reserve requirements
* Interest rate settings

### Open market operations

Buying or selling securities; usually US Treasury bills since the market for these securities is
the most liquid market and can absorb Fed transactions without excessive price fluctuation.
Buying securities increases the monetary supply thus decreasing interest rates.

### Discount policy - lender of last resort

Backup lending facility to federal funds. Controls  the funding rate via the discount rate. The
discount rate is +1% of the funding rate. Secondary rate is provided to banks in trouble (+0.5%
of the discount rate).

### Reserve requirements

All depository institutions are subject to the same reserve requirements and need to hold a ratio
of checkable deposits.

### Interest rate settings

* Reduces the opportunity cost of holding reserves
* Helps improve monetary policy. Fluctuations in excess reserves are reduced, floor under the federal
funding rate.
* Liquidity increase via expansion of the Fed's lending facilities.

Interest rate increases: supply is elastic, banks want to lend rather than borrow
Interest rate approaces the discount rate: demand is elastic, banks want to borrow

### OMO vs the rest

#### Advantages of OMO

1. They occur at the initiative of the Fed vs borrowed reserves
2. Flexible and precise, no matter how small or large a change in reserves or the monetary base is required.
3. Easily reversible
4. Can be implemented quickly vs changes in reserve requirements

#### Advantages over OMO

1. Increase of reserve interest rate will increase the federal funds rate in order to reduce excess reserves
2. Use of discount policy as a lender of last resort


## Non-conventional monetary policy

### Liquidity provision

1. discount window expansion, ie., lower the discount rate further
2. term auction facility, ie., loans with a rate determined by auctions
3. new lending programs

### Asset purchases

### Quantitative easing

Expansion of the central bank balance sheet.

### Commitment to future policy actions

Management of expectations. Eg., committing to low short-term interest rates for some time brings down long-term
interest rates.

## Inflation targetting

Price stability is the long-term goal. Inflation targetting is used to achieve price stability. It involves:
1. public announcement of medium-term targets.
2. institutional commitment to price stability as a long-term goal and to achieve the inflation goal.
3. information-inclusive approach in which many variables are included in making decisions about monetary
policy.
4. increased transparency of monetary policy strategy via communication with the public about the plans and
objectives of the monetary policymakers.
5. increased accountability of the central bank.

### How should the central bank respond to asset-price bubbles

"lean vs clean" debate: whether monetary policy should try to pop or slow the growth of potential asset-price
bubbles to minimize damage to the economy when the bubbles bursts.

Respond directly to asset-price bubbles or only after a bubble bursts?

The Greenspan doctrine = clean

## How to chose the federal funds rate

### The Taylor rule

ff rate = inflation rate + equilibrium ff rate + 1/2(inflation gap) + 1/2(output gap)

equilibrium ff rate: consistent with full employment in the long run
inflation gap: current inflation - target inflation
output gap: current GDP - target GDP

Disadvantage: high output relative to potential as measured by low unemployment has not seemed to produce
higher inflation in recent years.

### The MacCallum rule
