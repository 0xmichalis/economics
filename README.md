# money stuff

This repository contains a mix of my notes from FIN512 of the University of Nicosia
and other sources. The goal of this work is to provide an educational source that is
easy to grok for anyone who wants to learn about economics.

Note that nothing in this repository is financial or investment advice and it may
also be wildly inaccurate (happy to accept pull requests with fixes!). Use at your
own risk!

The assets provided in `assets/The_weaponization_of_centralized_finance` are not mine
but come from a QCP Capital report from 2022.
