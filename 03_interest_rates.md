# Interest rates

```
Pv = Cf / (1 + i)ⁿ
```

where:

Pv: present value
Cf: cash flow
i: annual interest rate
n: years to maturity

Simple interest rate equals the yield to maturity for **simple loans**.

For **fixed payment loans**:

```
Lv = (Fp / (1 + i)) + (Fp / (1 + i)²) + ... + (Fp / (1 + i)ⁿ)
```

where:

Lv: loan value
Fp: fixed yearly payment
n: years to maturity

For **coupon bonds**:

```
P = (C / (1 + i)) + (C / (1 + i)²) + ... + (C / (1 + i)ⁿ) + (F / (1 + i)ⁿ)
```

where:

P: price of coupon bond
C: yearly coupon bond payment
F: face value of the bond
n: years to maturity

**Discound bonds**

Similar to simple loans

Principal: amount of funds loaned
Perpetuity: coupon bond with no maturity date and no principal repayment that pays C forever

**Rate of return** is the payments to the owner plus the changes in its value, expressed as a
fraction of its purchase price.

```
R = iᵢ  + g
```

**Rate of capital gain (g)** is the change in the bond's price relative to the initial purchase
price.

**Interest-rate risk** is the riskiness of an asset's return that results from interest-rate changes.

**Nominal interest rates**, no allowance for inflation

**Real interest rates** adjust according to the price level (nominal rates + inflation)

### Fisher equation

```
r = i - pᵢ
```

where:

r: real interest rate
i: nominal interest rate
pᵢ: expected inflation rate

When the real interest rate is low, there are greater incentives to borrow and fewer incentives to lend.

**After-tax real interest rate** equals the nominal interest rate after income taxes have been deducted, minus
expected inflation rate.

```
r = i(1 - t) - pᵢ
```

where:

t: income tax rate


## Theory of portfolio choice

### Determinants of asset demand

1. Wealth (🡥 🡥)

Holding everything else constant, an increase in wealth increases the quantity demanded of an asset.

2. Expected return (🡥 🡥)

Holding everything else constant, an increase in an asset's expected return relative to that of alternative
assets increases the quantity demanded of the asset.

3. Risk (🡥 🡧)

Holding everything else constant, if an asset's risk rises relative to that of alternative assets, its quantity
demand will fall.

4. Liquidity (🡥 🡥)

Holding everything else constant, the more liquid an asset is relative to alternative assets, the greater its
quantity demand.


## Bond supply and demand

### Shifts in the demand of bonds

*When X goes up (🡥), bonds go 🡥 or 🡧*

1. Wealth 🡥 🡥
2. Interest rates 🡥 🡧
3. Expected inflation 🡥 🡧
4. Risk 🡥 🡥
5. Liquidity 🡥 🡥


### Shifts in the supply of bonds

1. Expected profitability of investments 🡥 🡥
2. Expected inflation* 🡥 🡥
3. Government deficit 🡥 🡥

**Ceteris paribus**: When a variable change is examined, all other variables are assumed to stay constant.

\***Fisher effect**: When expected inflation rises, expected interest rates rise because bond prices fall and
bond prices negatively affect interest rates. Confirmed by empirical observation.


## Why people hold money (according to Keynesian theory)

1. Transactions (medium of exchange)
2. Precautions (unexpected wants/needs)
3. Speculation (store of wealth)

Putting it all together: **Liquidity preference**

Interest is not a reward for saving money but for sacrificing liquidity.

```
M / P = L(i, Q)  (1)
```

where:

M: Money supply
P: Average price levels
L: Liquidity
i: interest rates

Remember the formula from Quantity Theory:

```
MV = PQ  <=> V = PQ / M  =(1)=> V = Q / L(i, Q)
```

If interest rates fluctuate substantially, velocity can also fluctuate.


### Shifts in the demand for money

1. Income effect

Higher income causes the demand for money at each interest rate to increase and the demand curve to shift
to the right.

2. Price level effect

A rise in price levels causes the demand for money at each interest rate to increase and the demand curve
to shift to the right.

### Shifts in the supply of money

Assumed it is completely controller by the central bank.

**The liquidity effect**: when the money supply increases, interest rates decrease.


## Risk structure of interest rates

The relationship among bonds with the same term to maturity and different interest rates.

1. Default risk

When the issuer of the bond is unable or unwilling to make interest payments. Government bonds are default-free
since governments can always increases taxes or print money.

The spread in interest rates between default and default-free bonds is called **risk premium**. It indicates
how much more interest people earn to be willing to hold the risky bond.

2. Liquidity

Less liquidity equals less demand (demand curve shifts to the left)

3. Income tax considerations

Municipal bonds in US are exempt from federal income tax. This makes them more desirable shift their demand
curve rightwards.


## Term structure of interest rates

A bond's term to maturity influences its interest rate.

A plot on the yields of bonds with different terms to maturity but the same risk. liquidity, and tax considerations
is called **yield curve**.

Short-term low interest rates and longer-term higher interest rates => upwards-sloping curves

Constant interest rates => flat curves

Higher short-term than long-term interest rates => downwards-sloping curves

Apart from yield curves:
1. interest rates on bonds of different maturities move together over time
2. short-term low rates => upwards yield curves, and vice versa
3. yield curves usually slope upwards

### Expectations theory

The interest rate on a long-term bond will equal the average of the short-term interest rates that people expect to
occur over the life of the long-term bond.

Short-term interest rates are epxected to have different values at future dates. If short-term interests increase
today they will tend to be higher in the future. Since long-term interest rates are the average of expected future
short-term rates, they will also tend to increase. Hence, the expectations theory explain point 1. above.

Also, on point 2., when short-term interest rates are low, people expect they will rise in the future. And vice versa.

Assumes bonds of different maturities can be perfect substitutes.

### Segmented market theory

Bonds of different maturities are not substitutes at all so the expected return of holding a bond of one maturity has
no effect on the demand for bonds of another maturity.

Strong preference on bonds of a specific maturity. Most likely the holding period is going to equal maturity which
implies almost no risk.

Explains point 3.: since most investors prefer short-term bonds, long-term bonds have lower demand thus lower prices
and high interest rates, thus the upwards slope in the yield curve.

### Liquidity premium theory

A combination of the expectations theory and the segmented market theory. A long-term interest rate will be the sum of
a liquidity premium and the average of short-term interest rates that are expected to occur over the life of the long-term
bond.
